Alfred Python Module
====================

I borrowed this code Jinn Lynn's Alfred workflows. You can visit him at [http://jeeker.net](). I couldn't find a direct link to his Alfred module there, which is why I put it here. The code is licensed under the MIT license. See [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT]() for more details.
