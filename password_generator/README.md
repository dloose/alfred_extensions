All credit goes to Randall Munroe, Jeff Preshing, and Jinn Lynn. Please blame them if something goes horribly wrong (kidding!)

The concept comes from Mr. Munroe's excellent web comic, XKCD. For an explanation of why you'd want to use these passwords instead of randomly-generated gobbledegook, see [http://xkcd.com/936/]()

The code is a poorly-ported Python version of Mr. Preshing's original JavaScript on [http://passphra.se](). The original is available from http://passphra.se/passphrase.js.php?language=en licensed under a modified version of the BSD license. See the included pw_gen.py file for more details.

I borrowed Jinn Lynn's Python module for Alfred integration. Visit him at [http://jeeker.net](). I couldn't find a direct link to his Alfred module, but it's included in this bundle (obviously). The code is licensed under the MIT license. See [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT]() for more details.
