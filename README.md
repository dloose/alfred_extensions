Alfred Extensions
=================

Just a couple of [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflows I developed. If you find them useful, let me know.

* `password_generator` generates a couple of passwords based on [http://xkcd.com/936/](). Download it from [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30180245/Alfred/Password%20Generator.alfredworkflow]()
* `screen_sharing` starts a screen sharing session with a remote host. Download it from [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30180245/Alfred/Start%20Screen%20Sharing.alfredworkflow]()

I borrowed Jinn Lynn's Python module for Alfred integration. Visit him at [http://jeeker.net](). I couldn't find a direct link to his Alfred module, but it's included in this bundle (obviously). The code is licensed under the MIT license. See [http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT]() for more details.
