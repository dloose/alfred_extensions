Alfred Extensions
=================

Just an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflow I developed. If you find it useful, let me know.

* `password_generator` generates a couple of passwords based on [http://xkcd.com/936/](http://xkcd.com/936/). Build it with the included `build.sh` script.

I borrowed Jinn Lynn's Python module for Alfred integration. Visit him at [http://jeeker.net](http://jeeker.net). I couldn't find a direct link to his Alfred module, but it's included in this bundle (obviously). The code is licensed under the MIT license.
